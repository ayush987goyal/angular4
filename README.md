# angular4

This is a repo containing all the projects I created while learning Angular.

You can clone the repository or download any individual project and run the following command in the project directory and Node installed in your system

`npm install`

This will install the dependency modules. You can now serve the project to a server by simply running the following command.

`ng serve`

Cheers!
